## Algorithms

1. Cubic Time Complexity (O(n³))
2. Quadratic Time Complexity (O(n²))
3. Log-Linear Time Complexity (O(n log n))
4. Linear Time Complexity (O(n))

## Usage

Compile and run the `mss.java` file:

```bash
javac mss.java
java mss
```

The program will execute all four algorithms on a sample array and print the results.
